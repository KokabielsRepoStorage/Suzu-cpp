##If you pay attention, 41 of the 42 commands have not been added

##Benifits
### When this is done :
#### Faster
Because of c++ being a faster language, it will be able to run faster and mainly will be slowed down by api rates
#### Same commands
It will have the same commands I hope


## Downsides
Way higher storage needed (In current state : Code is 1gb JS code size : 626 megabytes)
Less liked language (Js is one of the most popular languages in the world.)
I dont know if I can do custom images.
